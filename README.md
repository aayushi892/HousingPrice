# üè° House Price Prediction using Regression

## üìñ Overview

Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! This endeavor leverages regression techniques to estimate house prices based on various features, helping buyers and real estate professionals make informed decisions in the competitive housing market. By using advanced algorithms, we uncover the hidden patterns that drive property values.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Data Collection**: Gather a rich dataset featuring house prices and their associated attributes.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data by addressing missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing numerical data.
- **Model Development**: Employ a variety of regression techniques, including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regression
  - Random Forest Regression
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance with metrics such as:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R-squared
- **Visualization**: Generate insightful visualizations to illustrate relationships between features and house prices.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [insert source, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository] and contains the following features:

| Feature          | Description                             |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Location**     | Neighborhood or district of the house  |
| **Size**         | Square footage of the house             |
| **Rooms**        | Total number of rooms in the house      |
| **Year Built**   | Year the house was constructed          |
| **Garage**       | Presence and size of a garage           |
| **Price**        | Target variable (market price of the house) |

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

### Training the Model

To train the regression model, run:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

### Making Predictions

To make predictions on new data, use:

```bash
python predict.py --data new_house_data.csv
```

## üîÆ Future Work

We envision several enhancements for future versions of this project, including:

- Expanding the dataset to encompass more diverse properties and geographic areas.
- Implementing advanced regression techniques such as Gradient Boosting or XGBoost.
- Developing a user-friendly web application for real-time house price predictions.
